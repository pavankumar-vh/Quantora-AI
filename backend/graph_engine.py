graph_engine.py — Quantora AI Transaction Graph Engine
=======================================================

Maintains an in-memory transaction network graph using NetworkX.
Provides real-time graph feature extraction for the SAGRA algorithm.

Architecture Notes (Prototype vs. Production):
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  CURRENT (Prototype / Demo)                                 │
    │  • In-memory NetworkX graph                                 │
    │  • Single-process, no persistence                           │
    │  • Centrality recalculated on each request                  │
    │  • Suitable for demos, presentations, and local testing     │

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  PRODUCTION (Enterprise Deployment)                         │
    │  • Neo4j or Amazon Neptune for persistent graph storage     │
    │  • Apache Kafka / Pulsar for streaming transaction ingestion│
    │  • Incremental centrality updates (not full recomputation)  │
    │  • Graph partitioning for horizontal scaling                │
    │  • Cached centrality scores with TTL-based invalidation     │
    │  • Target: <200ms end-to-end inference latency              │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Centrality Recalculation Trade-offs:
    - Full recalculation (current): O(V + E) per request. Acceptable for
      graphs with <10K nodes. Provides exact centrality values.
    - Incremental update: Only recompute affected neighborhoods. Much faster
      for large graphs but introduces approximation error.
    - Cached with TTL: Pre-compute centrality periodically (e.g., every 60s).
      Near-zero latency at read time but stale by up to TTL duration.
    - For production with millions of nodes, incremental + caching is
      the recommended hybrid approach.

        detection, both incoming and outgoing connections indicate
